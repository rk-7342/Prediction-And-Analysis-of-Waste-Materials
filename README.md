Libraries Used:

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn â†’ Data processing & visualization
sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.ensemble â†’ Machine learning
sklearn.metrics â†’ Model evaluation
First Few Code Snippets:

Imports ML-related libraries.
Reads a CSV file named "Smart_Bin.csv", suggesting it's working with waste management data.

Imports Necessary Libraries:

Uses pandas, numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
sklearn for machine learning modeling (Random Forest, Linear Regression)

Loads Waste Management Data (Smart_Bin.csv):
Reads a dataset containing information about waste levels, sensor readings, or bin status.
Uses df.head(10) and df.tail(10) to inspect the data.
Preprocesses Data:

Extracts first 10 and last 10 rows to analyze trends
This suggests it might be handling bin status updates or sensor readings over time.
Expected Output & Insights
ðŸ“Š Key Takeaways from the Notebook:

Classifies or predicts waste bin status using machine learning
Preprocesses and cleans sensor data before model training
Visualizes data trends using seaborn
Might be predicting when bins need to be emptied
